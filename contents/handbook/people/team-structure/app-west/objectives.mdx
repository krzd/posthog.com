- Objectives: Enable customers to query the clickhouse database with SQL and return table form data (and maybe graphing) with 5 happy companies for the feature launch
    - Key result:
        - _Team to fill in_
    - Why?
        - We can see users sending all their data to a warehouse to query it there, just to debug PostHog sometimes.
        - This would be used by our existing users so makes sense to prioritise ahead of ie a CRM / marketing tool etc.
- Objective: Enable customers to create insights with SQL (switch from GUI query builder to SQL query builder and back) with 5 happy companies for the feature launch
    - Key result:
        - Team to fill in
    - Why?
        - SQL access makes our existing analytics much more powerful and solves dozens of edge cases in one go. This will delight + increase word of mouth growth.


- Out of scope for this quarter but potential roadmap
    - If we build "Enable customers to query the clickhouse database with SQL" directly into the product, we _know_ that customers will want to integrate with other data we donâ€™t have access to
    - As a second step we could connect to other data sources sources
    - This is probably a better path than integrating with Metabase as that would require significant engineering effort
    - Charging for feature flags - likely next quarter after the session recording billing infra is done
