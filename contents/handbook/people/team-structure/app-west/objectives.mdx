## Original proposal:
- Objectives: Enable customers to query the clickhouse database with SQL and return table form data (and maybe graphing) with 5 happy companies for the feature launch
    - Key result:
        - _Team to fill in_
    - Why?
        - We can see users sending all their data to a warehouse to query it there, just to debug PostHog sometimes.
        - This would be used by our existing users so makes sense to prioritise ahead of ie a CRM / marketing tool etc.
- Objective: Enable customers to create insights with SQL (switch from GUI query builder to SQL query builder and back) with 5 happy companies for the feature launch
    - Key result:
        - Team to fill in
    - Why?
        - SQL access makes our existing analytics much more powerful and solves dozens of edge cases in one go. This will delight + increase word of mouth growth.


- Out of scope for this quarter but potential roadmap
    - If we build "Enable customers to query the clickhouse database with SQL" directly into the product, we _know_ that customers will want to integrate with other data we donâ€™t have access to
    - As a second step we could connect to other data sources sources
    - This is probably a better path than integrating with Metabase as that would require significant engineering effort
    - Charging for feature flags - likely next quarter after the session recording billing infra is done

## Working OKRs

- Objective: Increase organisations using experiments within 2 weeks of signing up from X% to Y%

    - (The below are still a work in progress)
    - Key Result: Increase activation of newly signed up users/organizations on experiments from X% to Y%
    - Key Result: Increase number of experiments (per team?) run from X to Y
    - Key Result: Re-activate X number of users/organizations who have churned
    - Key Result: Cross-activate X number of existing users/organizations who don't currently use experiments
    - Key Result: Get X number of feature flag users/organizations to try running their first experiment
    - Key Result: Resolve all currently tracked experimentation bugs
    - Key Result: Resolve any new experimentation bugs within 2 days
    - Key Result: Get 100 experiments completed

- Objective: Launch Direct SQL Querying Beta with 5 happy customers
    - (The below are still a work in progress)
    - Key Result: Launch feature on cloud and self-hosted
    - Key Result: Enable examination of any GUI based query on this feature
    - Key Result: Enable customers to create insights with SQL
    - Key Result: Activate 10 existing users who retain X days/weeks on this feature
